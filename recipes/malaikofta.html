        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A delicious and creamy Indian dish that uses potatoes to form the kofta. 
            It is slightly sweet with the perfect amount of spice.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>potatoes</li>
            <li>tofu</li>
            <li>corn starch</li>
            <li>cilantro</li>
            <li>lemon juice</li>
            <li>garam masala</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>green peas</li>
            <li>oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First cook the potatoes for the kofta. Peel and cut the potatoes in half, then place them in a pot
                 and cover with water. Place a lid on the pot and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Turn the heat 
                 to medium and let boil for 10-15 minutes until the potatoes are fully cooked and easily pierced with a 
                 fork. Drain the hot water from the potatoes, mash them until smooth, and set aside.</li>
            <li>While the potatoes are cooking, start the curry tomato cream sauce. In a large heavy bottomed pot add the onion, canned tomatoes and their juices, cashews, garlic, ginger, garam masala, turmeric, cayenne, and salt. If you are using fenugreek seeds instead of kasoori methi, also add the fenugreek seeds at this point. Cover the pot and bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Let simmer covered for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Transfer the onion and tomato mixture to a blender and blend until smooth, making sure to vent so hot air doesn't build up in the blender. Alternatively, you can use an immersion blender, but the final sauce will not be as silky smooth. Pour the creamy mixture back into the pot and add the coconut milk, reserving ~1/4 cup back to serve and crush the methi in your fingers and add to the pot. Mix together and cover the pot and set aside until the kofta are ready.</li>
        </ol>
